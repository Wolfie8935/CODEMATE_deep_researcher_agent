Query: how is cyclone intensity achieved
Summary:
The most important factor for estimating cyclone intensity was determined to be the surface pressure
caused by the core of the cyclone. Surface pressure was selected as the main target variable. 22 of
the most releva nt predictors for cycloneintensity estimation were found.
