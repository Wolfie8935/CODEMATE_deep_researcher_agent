DETAILED ANALYSIS
==================================================

1. What is the relationship between what in the context of the query?
----------------------------------------
Confidence: 🟡 0.66

Answer:
SGLD uses min i-batches to compute a noisy gradient of the log -likelihood, adds
Gaussian noise, and slowly decays the step size. SGLD has been applied, for
example, to Bayesian deep learning.

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. What is the relationship between what in the context of the query?

**Answer:** SGLD uses min i-batches to compute a noisy gradient of the log -likelihood, adds Gaussian noise, and slowly decays the step size. SGLD has been applied, for example, to Bayesian deep learning.

**Confidence:** 0.66

**Evidence:**

   ion that the posterior is the Gaussian Distribution 
𝑝(θ∣𝐷)=𝒩(θ∣∣ν,σ2𝐼) for some mean 𝜈 and variance 𝜎2. Logistic regression sets the likelihood 
as p(t=1∣x,θ)=σ(θ⊤u(x)) for a feature of vectors u(x). For this model , what shall be the 
ensemble predictive distribution  
𝑝(𝑡∣𝑥,𝐷)=𝐸θ∼ℕ(θ∣∣∣ν,σ𝟚𝐼)[σ(θ⊤𝑢(𝑥))] 
𝑝(𝑡∣𝑥,𝐷)≈σ

A larger variance σ2 of the posterior decreases the confidence of the prediction by reducing t he

   gets t 
directly, rather than modelling the conditional distribution given inputs x. This setup is most common 
in density estimation problems such as:  
- Estimating a distribution from samples (e.g. Estimating a gaussian distribution from data)  
- Learning a generative model for the data  
Basically, what happens since x doesn’t influence the likelihood, the learning problem becomes 
independent of the covariates. We only update the beliefs about 𝜃 based on observed data t, without 
needing t...

   ike stochastic gradient descent) but injects carefully scaled noise so that in the limit it samples from 
the posterior. In effect, one treats the optimization trajectory itself as a sampling process. Practically, 
SGLD uses min i-batches to compute a noisy gradient of the log -likelihood, adds Gaussian noise, and 
slowly decays the step size. The result is that the parameters “wander” around a local mode, producing 
approximate samples of the posterior. It can be viewed as a variant  of Langevi...

   erance. This allows us to perform Bayesian inference even when the likelihood is unavailable, making ABC an 
essential tool for complex scientific models, e.g., in genetics, ecology, and epidemiology. Importance sampling  
Importance sampling is a Monte Carlo technique for approximating expectations with respect to one 
distribution by sampling from another. One draws samples from a convenient proposal distribution 
and then weights each sample by the ratio of the target densi ty to the proposal...

   te Carlo method for evaluating properties of a particular distribution while only 
having samples from a different distribution”. The weights correct for the mismatch between the 
proposal and target. Importance sampling is unbiased and simple, but it can s uffer from high variance 
if the proposal does not cover the target well. In practice, it is often used as a building rather than a 
standalone posterior sampler. Basically, sometimes  we can’t/ don’t want to sample from the true posterior 𝑝(...
