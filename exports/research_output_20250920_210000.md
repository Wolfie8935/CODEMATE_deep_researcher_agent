# Research Query: how is cyclone intensity acheived?

## Final Answer
Query: how is cyclone intensity acheived?
Summary:
The most important factor for estimating cyclone intensity was determined to be surface pressure.
Category 1 is most frequent (62.28%), Category 5 is 21.25%, indicating strong cyclones do occur with
great frequency. Category 2 and 3 are less common, at 7.88% and 5.47%, respectively.
