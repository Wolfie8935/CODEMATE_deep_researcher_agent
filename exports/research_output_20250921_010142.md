DETAILED ANALYSIS
==================================================

1. What are the main sections
----------------------------------------
Confidence: 🟡 0.66

Answer:
MH methods generate candidate samples in an adaptive way. These are correlated
and may require long time to explore the posterior domain. Rejection sampling
draws i.i.d. samples from posterior which is inefficient.

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. What are the main sections

**Answer:** MH methods generate candidate samples in an adaptive way. These are correlated and may require long time to explore the posterior domain. Rejection sampling draws i.i.d. samples from posterior which is inefficient.

the fixed constants. The target is the model parameter vector θ. 𝑃(𝜃|𝐷)=𝑃(𝐷|𝜃)𝑃(𝜃)

accepted samples follow the posterior distribution. Generate samples θ1…….θ𝑠 ~ 𝑝(θ|𝐷) using accept/ reject logic  
𝑝(θ|acc)=𝑝(θ)𝑝(acc|θ)
𝑝(acc) 
𝑝(acc)=∫𝑝(θ′)𝑝(acc|θ′)ⅆθ′ 
Here θ1′……θ𝑠′ i.i.d. from prior 𝑝(θ) [known]  
𝑝(acc|𝜃′): acceptance probability  
Our main goal is to satisfy  
𝑝(θ|acc)=𝑝(θ|𝐷)∝𝑝(θ)𝑝(𝐷|θ) 
Combining we get 𝑝(acc|θ)∝𝑝(𝐷|θ) 
𝑝(acc|θ)=𝑝(𝐷|θ)

   Concretely, 
starting from a current sample, MH draws a candidate and then computes an acceptance probability 
(typically 𝑚𝑖𝑛 (1,𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡(𝑐𝑎𝑛ⅆ𝑖ⅆ𝑎𝑡𝑒 )/𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡(𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡)), adjusting for proposal asymmetry). If 
accepted, the chain moves to the candidate; if rejected, it stays at the current point. Over many steps, 
this Markov chain’s stationary distribution is exactly the desired posterior . We know Rejection sampling draws i.i.d. samples from posterior which is highly inefficient when the 
prior is ...

in the neighbourhood of last accepted sample θ𝑠. These are correlated and may require long time to 
explore the entire posterior domain. It uses transition distribution 𝑝(θ′|θ) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Posterior ratio:  
𝑝(θ′|𝐷)
𝑝(θ|𝐷)=𝑝(θ′)𝑝(𝐷|θ′)
𝑝(θ)𝑝(𝐷|θ) 
Accept θ> 1. Still accept θ< 1 but with room for exploration . Transition Ratio: 𝑝(θ𝑠|θ′)
𝑝(θ′|θ𝑠) = 1 (symmetric)  
Our probability of acceptance is ∝ improvement in the posterior obta...
