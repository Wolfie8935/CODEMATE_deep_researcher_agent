    <h2>Detailed Analysis</h2>

    <h3>1. What is the relationship between what in the context of the query?</h3>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Lasso Regression achieves automatic feature selection by setting irrelevant variable coefficients to zero. It is useful in high-dimensional data such as ERA5, where most features have minimal importance. Model provides a baseline to compare against.</p>
    <p><strong>Confidence:</strong> <span class="confidence medium">0.67</span></p>

        Model provides a baseline to compare against. It 
works well if there is a linear correlation between cyclone 
intensity and meteorological parameters (e.g., wind speed, 
mean sea level). There are some drawbacks: it is unable to 
capture complex and non -linear  interactions since cyclone 
intensit...
