Proposed an ML-based approach to predict cyclone intensity using the\nERA5 data set. The framework ac hieves higher accuracy compared to existing\nmodels.\n\nSources (5):\n  [1] Cyclone Intensity Prediction using ERA5.pdf (n.d.). Retrieved from local database.

PROPOSED METHODOLOGY  \nCyclones are prevalent in coastal areas. In the Indian \nsubcontinent, primarily West Bengal, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu are hit by cyclones. There is no \nmachine or model that can tell us what is going to happen in \nthe next few days . The research work proposes  a machine learning model that \nassists in predicting storm  intensity  by considering 22 \nindependent features and providing the output as surface \npressure which help in predicting the intensity of cyclone . The predictive pipeline consists of the following models : \nA. Linear Regression  \n             Model provides a baseline to compare against. It \nworks well if there is a linear correlation between cyclone \nintensity and meteorological parameters (e.g., wind speed, \nmean sea level).",
