Answer:
Lasso Regression achieves automatic feature selection by setting irrelevant
variable coefficients to zero. It is useful in high-dimensional data such as
ERA5, where most features have minimal importance. Model provides a baseline to
compare against.

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. What is the relationship between what in the context of the query?

**Answer:** Lasso Regression achieves automatic feature selection by setting irrelevant variable coefficients to zero. It is useful in high-dimensional data such as ERA5, where most features have minimal importance. Model provides a baseline to compare against.

**Confidence:** 0.67

   Model provides a baseline to compare against. It 
works well if there is a linear correlation between cyclone 
intensity and meteorological parameters (e.g., wind speed, 
mean sea level). There are some drawbacks: it is unable to 
capture complex and non -linear  interactions since cyclone 
intensity is influenced by them , high multicollinearity 
between meteorological parameters impacts model stability; 
and it is outlier -sensitive. B. Lasso Regression  
       Model achieves automatic featur...

   tigated in the present work, with ML methods may 
provide a very effective avenue towards enhanced cyc lone 
intensity prediction . III. PROPOSED METHODOLOGY  
Cyclones are prevalent in coastal areas. In the Indian 
subcontinent, primarily West Bengal, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu are hit by cyclones. There is no 
machine or model that can tell us what is going to happen in 
the next few days . The research work proposes  a machine learning model that 
assists in predicting storm  inte...

   however, subject to some 
limitations: it deletes significant variables, resulting in an 
underfitted model or incorrect prediction, and it does not 
perform well with highly correlated features . C. Ridge Regression  
            Model handles multicollinearity by scaling down 
coefficient values, and it is useful when several features 
contribute to cyclone intensity in a dependent relationship. Its 
limitations are that it does not perform feature selection and 
makes the assumption o f a lin...

   nsities of cyclones and is good when a specific intensity is 
consistently underestimated. Nevertheless, limitations of this 
approach are that it is noise sensitive and computationally 
intensive. I. Support Vector Regression (SVR)  
            Model employs kernel tricks to describe complicated, 
non-linear relationships between meteorological parameters 
and cyclone intensity and performs well when the relationship 
is not clearly known. Its shortcomings, however, are that it is 
extremely s...

5. **Cyclone Intensity Prediction using ERA5.pdf** (relevance: 0.150)
   Model is capable of capturing non -linear 
relationships and interactions between features and 
automatically identifies significant meteorological variables 
that affect cyclone intensity. But its drawbacks are that it has 
high variance and is susceptible to o verfitting, and it can 
produce varied tree structures. G. Random Forest Regressor  
            Model ensembles several decision trees, preventing 
overfitting and still preserving the ability to model non -
linearity. It performs well ...
