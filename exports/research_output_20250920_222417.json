It \nworks well if there is a linear correlation between cyclone \nintensity and meteorological parameters (e.g., wind speed, \nmean sea level). There are some drawbacks: it is unable to \ncapture complex and non -linear  interactions since cyclone \nintensity is influenced by them , high multicollinearity \nbetween meteorological parameters impacts model stability; \nand it is outlier -sensitive.

It is, however, subject to some \nlimitations: it deletes significant variables, resulting in an \nunderfitted model or incorrect prediction, and it does not \nperform well with highly correlated features .
