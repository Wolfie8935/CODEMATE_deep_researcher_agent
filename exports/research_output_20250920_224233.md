----------------------------------------
Confidence: 🟢 0.72

Answer:
Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) is a modern MCMC method that scales
Bayesian sampling to large datasets and models. SGLD uses min i-batches to
compute a noisy gradient of the log -likelihood, adds Gaussian noise, and slowly
decays the step size.
